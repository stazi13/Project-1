# Project-1
Process of ELK VM build during NU Cybersecurity Bootcamp 2021

## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the __playbook___ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly ___accessible__, in addition to restricting __inbound traffic___ to the network.
- ___The load balancer protects by filtering traffic to the proper location - a private cloud server. ELK monitors the traffic and data at a more human readible view in order to monitor the VMs for any changes_

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the __files___ and system __logs___.
- Filebeat watches for the file system, including which files have changed and when. For this project, it monitors the Apache server and MySQL database logs generated by the DVWA
- Metricbeat periodically collects metrics from the operating system (such as system CPU, memory and load) and services running on the server such as Apache. In this project, it primarily pays attention to the new container performance metrics. 

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function    | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway     | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web 1    | Server      | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web 2    | Server      | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELK VM   | Monitoring  | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the __authorized___ machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
My public IP: 24.13.179.174
Jump Box 20.80.32.214


Machines within the network can only be accessed by _the jump box____.
- Jump Box 20.80.32.214

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | 20.80.32.214         |
| Web 1    | No                  | 20.80.38.98          |
| Web 2    | No                  | 20.80.38.98          |
| ELK VM   | No                  | 20.102.64.93         |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- there is less room for error. It is also easier to install and update and monitor the chosen VMs. 

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install docker.io
- Install pip3
- Install docker python module
- Updated the sysctl module to use more memory
- Download and launch a docker elk container
- Enable service docker on boot

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
Web 1	 20.80.38.98
Web 2	 20.80.38.98

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
Filebeat & Metric Beat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat helps generate and log files containing information about the file system, including which files have changed and when. For this project, it monitors the Apache server and MySQL database logs generated by the DVWA
- Metricbeat periodically collects metrics from the operating system (such as system CPU, memory and load) and services running on the server such as Apache. In this project, it primarily pays attention to the new container performance metrics. 

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the __.yml___ file to __/etc/ansible directory___.
- Update the __hosts___ file to include...the chosen VMs (Web 1 and Web 2). 
- Run the playbook, and navigate to __the Kibana url (http://20.102.64.93:5601/app/kibana#/home)__ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_ ___[Metricbeat Playbook](https://github.com/stazi13/Project-1/blob/main/MetricBeatPlaybook.png?raw=true "Metricbeat Playbook") and [Filebeat Playbook](https://github.com/stazi13/Project-1/blob/main/FileBeatPlaybook.png?raw=true "Filebeat Playbook") copied to /etc/ansible/roles directory ___
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_ ___You can make adjustments to the hosts file in the /etc/ansible directory___
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://20.102.64.93:5601/app/kibana#/home
