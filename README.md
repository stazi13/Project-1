# Project-1
Process of ELK VM build during NU Cybersecurity Bootcamp 2021

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly __secure___, in addition to restricting __access___ to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the __files___ and system __logs___.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_ Filebeat watches for the file system, including which files have changed and when. For this project, it monitors the Apache server and MySQL database logs generated by the DVWA
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_ Metricbeat periodically collects metrics from the operating system (such as system CPU, memory and load) and services running on the server such as Apache. In this project, it primarily pays attention to the new container performance metrics. 

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web 1    |          | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web 2    |          | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELK VM   |          | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the __authorized___ machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- _TODO: Add whitelisted IP addresses_
My public IP: 24.13.179.174
Jump Box 20.80.32.214


Machines within the network can only be accessed by _the jump box____.
- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?_
Jump Box 20.80.32.214

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | No                  | 10.0.0.4             |
|          |                     |                      |
|          |                     |                      |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_
Less room for errors.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install docker.io
- Install pip3
- Install docker python module
- Updated the sysctl module to use more memory
- Download and launch a docker elk container
- Enable service docker on boot

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_
Web 1	 20.80.38.98
Web 2	 20.80.38.98

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_
Filebeat & Metric Beat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat helps generate and log files containing information about the file system, including which files have changed and when. For this project, it monitors the Apache server and MySQL database logs generated by the DVWA
- Metricbeat periodically collects metrics from the operating system (such as system CPU, memory and load) and services running on the server such as Apache. In this project, it primarily pays attention to the new container performance metrics. 

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_ 
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://20.102.64.93:5601/app/kibana#/home

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
